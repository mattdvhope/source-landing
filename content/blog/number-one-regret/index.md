_“The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation.”_
-- Henry David Thoreau

Dear Reader,

I’d like to tell you the story of a “Mr. Smith.”

He lies upon his crib bed, barely able to lift his head. The doctors say he has only a days left now. “I never followed after my **DREAM**!” He laments. “I only did what ‘they’ told me I should do. Never what I wanted to do!”

Tears stream from Mr. Smith’s eyes. “They’d always told me to ‘play it safe. To never take any risks. But as I lie here at the threshold of the great beyond, I ache to turn back the hands of time. To return to my younger years. Then, I could launch out on some ‘risky venture.’ I could try something dangerous! I could soar to the skies, even though I might crash to the ground. But now I’ll never get the chance again. Forever!”

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.
