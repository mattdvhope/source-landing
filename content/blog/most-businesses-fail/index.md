Dear Reader,

According to most measures, only one third of small businesses survive beyond ten years.

What factors lead most businesses to failure? One major factor is poor marketing. Most small businesses do not put nearly enough effort into salesmanship and marketing. They put far more effort into the "doing of the thing" (building their product) rather than figuring out how to get people to actually buy that "thing."

The Source of All Wealth is designed to enable you, as the business owner, to overcome this all-important "marketing problem."

You may have heard that a business owner should spend far more time "working ON the business rather than working IN the business." But day-to-day reality gets in the way of that lofty goal.

This is, in fact, a very good goal to strive toward. The Source of All Wealth will stand beside you as your "business partner" -- finding enough paying customers to make your business profitable far beyond ten years.

In the coming days, I will show you how to begin your business relationship with The Source of All Wealth.
