Dear Reader,

Most Sales Letters stink. You and I both know that.

Within the next couple of months, I'll have my "Sales Letter Copywriting testing service" up and running to help businessmen like you transform your jalopy of a Sales Letter into a fine-tuned roadster.

In the meantime, start following my Facebook page and stay alert to any upcoming announcements. 

I will apply a unique mixture of "new-fangled data science" and "old-timer artistry" to your letter:

### New-fangled Data Science
I will test--with real prospects similar to your own--a whole slew of factors including your teaser copy, your headline, the body of your letter, your bullets (fascinations), your offer, your P.S.'s, your signature, etc. So much to test! I'll work through them all to the n-th degree until you radically bump up your response and conversion rates.

### Old-timer Artistry
I will apply the timeless principles of "Old School Copywriting Masters" like Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, and the many other greats to your letter.

Even though I fiddle with digital marketing data, as a history buff, my heart of hearts pines for the glorious ad-copy of old! When I get ahold of your letter, I will custom tailor it to "golden ad-copy standards of yonder days" before I hand it back to you.

### Online and Offline
Keep in mind, in addition to online letters, I also work with direct mail letters, magazine ads, newspaper ads, etc.

### A Brand New Sales Letter?
By the way, if you don't have a sales letter written up yet, no worries. I'll take a turn at it myself -- and test the living daylights out of your new letter before it goes out into the wild.

### Long Copy
One note before I go, I am very partial to LONG COPY. I go by the classic principle that "the more you write, the more you sell" -- as long as what you write grabs hold of the reader's heart and never lets it go! So if you send me a short, piddly little sales letter, get ready see it EXTENDED -- in some cases, immensely.

I'll be adding to this letter, too, by the way. It's currently under construction. ;-)
