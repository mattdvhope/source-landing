Dear Reader,

Most sales copy stinks.

You and I both know that.

Most display ads, brand image builders, video ads, and sales letters bore you to tears with their incalculable blandness. Your subconsciousness screams at them for the umpteenth time, "Why are you doing this to me!"

You and I are forced to endure hundreds of these "odes to artlessness" every single day.

### The long-forgotten past
It wasn't always like this.  Way back in the 1920s, ad copy sang. Ad copy told you stories. Ad copy spoke craftsmanship, finesse, and flair into your life. And do you know what? Ad copy in those days made you wanna buy!

Within the next couple of months, I will get my "Sales Letter Copywriting testing service" up and running to help businessmen like you transform your "modern lemon" of a Sales Letter into a fine-tuned roadster of classic design **that brings in loads more profits for you**.

### The Best of the New, the Best of the Old
I will apply a unique-in-all-the-world mixture of "new-fangled data science" and "old-timer artistry" to your letter:

### New-fangled Data Science
I will **rapidly test**--with real people similar to your prospects--a whole slew of factors including your teaser copy, your headline, the body of your letter, your bullets (fascinations), your testimonials, your offer, your signature, your P.S.'s, etc.

I will cycle through them all to the n-th degree until **you radically bump up your response and conversion rates**. Imagine jumping from a half percent conversion rate to a one percent conversion rate... or more.

And I'm not talking about has-been, water-under-the-bridge, been-there-done-that "A/B Testing" either. (That's so 20-teens.) I'm talkin' up-to-the-minute, latest-and-greatest, and yet still mega-battle-tested, SPRINT TESTING. Once I get done running your ad-copy through the sprint testing wringer, you'll have prospects TRANSFIXED to your ad-copy and **salivating to buy**!

I know what I said might sound like a bunch of snake-oil salesmanship hype, but it's not. I'm telling you the truth. And I've just proven it to you.

**_"How have you proven it to me, Matt?"_** you ask.

Question for you: Are you not now TRANSFIXED TO THIS SALES LETTER? Are you not now engaged and enraptured by the words flying in front of your eyeballs?

I believe you are.

Why?

Because I SPRINT TESTED the daylights out this ad-copy before it ever even got in front of your eyes. By your now avidly reading this letter, you have proven to yourself that my sprint testing system worked.

The old ad-man acronym, "A.I.D.A.," from the 1920s stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.

You can see how my sales letter attracted your "attention" in spades. And it has also attracted your "interest." It probably even kindled a fair amount of "desire" in your belly--**especially when you contemplate how your profits could soon soar**. In fact, it might take only a little nudge to encourage you toward "action."

Imagine getting your prospects to this point of "action" a whole lot quicker and a whole lot more frequently than ever before--orders of magnitude better than before. Imagine what that would mean to you.

Think of how ad-copy like this--**that transfixes the eyeballs & emotions of your hottest prospects**--could TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS AND YOUR LIFE!

### Old-timer Artistry
I will also apply the timeless principles of the "Old School Copywriting Masters" like Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, and the many other great "ad-men of old" to your letter.

Even though I fiddle with new-fangled data science, as a history buff, my heart of hearts pines for the glorious ad-copy style of days gone by.

So when I get ahold of your letter, I will custom tailor it to the "ad-copy golden standards of yonder years" before I hand it back to you.

Think of it this way. Would you rather gaze upon an edifice of late nineteenth century design or some structure slapped together today.

Take a look at a public library built a century ago: a beautiful work of architectural wonder.

Then take a look at one built today: UGLY! BORING! BLAND! SOULLESS!

That's the exact same feeling you get when you stare at most ad-copy these days. It reminds me of modern "art." Ugggh!

So what is the benefit of the "old gold" style of ad-copy over the "plastic vanilla" copy of today?

Why did ad-men back then write so much better copy than they do today?

You gotta understand the long odds against a sale the "ad men of old" had to face in those days. Back then, let's say you ran a newspaper ad or mailed out a direct mail piece to thousands of prospects. 

The prospect then would be staring at a piece of physical paper with a cut-out order form next to the ad-copy. The prospective customer would have to...

> 1. Find a scissor.
> 2. Cut out the order form.
> 3. Find a pen.
> 4. Fill out the order form.
> 5. Find an envelop in the house or go out and buy one.
> 6. Write the company address on the envelop.
> 7. Put the order form into the envelop.
> 8. Find a check and write it to the company.
> 9. Put the check in the envelop and seal it.
>10. Find a postage stamp or go out and buy one.
>11. Walk out to the mailbox and plop in the letter.
>12. Flip up the little red flag on the mailbox.
>13. And wait... and wait... and wait.

It's a wonder that salesmen sold ANYTHING back in those days! Yet they did.

But how?

The answer is that they were FORCED by such dire "selling headwinds" to write WORLD-CLASS COPY. The massive inconvenience of their "selling logistics" forced them to write immensely creative copy that would draw customers in like a high-powered magnet.

Modern copywriting today stinks to the high heavens because all a seller has to do is...

> 1. Slap up a website with some half-baked ad-copy on it and an order form.
> 2. Get the prospect to press the "Order" button.
> 3. Get the prospect to fill out an order form and click "SUBMIT". Done.

So "easy"... and so little incentive for producing world-class copywriting.

That's why most ad-copy these days does such a lousy job of bringing in revenue. It is almost universally plain, vanilla, vapid, and BLAND! BLAND! BLAND!

### Online and Offline
In glorious contrast, whether you sell with a website, social media, direct mail, magazine ads, or newspaper ads--or anything else--I will walk alongside you in the crafting of an ad-copy masterpiece.

### No Sales Letter yet?
If you don't have a sales letter written up yet, no worries. I'll take a turn at it myself -- and test the living daylights out of your new letter with real prospects before it goes out into the wild.

And when I say, "write a sales letter for you," you need to understand something.

The amount of time I spend with "pen to paper" is only a fraction of the time I'll spend on your letter. The vast majority of the time I spend in crafting this copywriting masterpiece for you will be in RESEARCH.

The copywriting legend Gary Halbert once said, "A great copywriter is not a great writer, but rather, a great LEARNER." Another copywriting legend, Eugene Schwartz, said, "Copywriting is not writing. It is assembling." What he meant was that if copywriting is done extremely well, the copywriter will ASSEMBLE the incredible BENEFITS that your product brings to a customer. And he will present these benefits in a way that sinks deep into the hearts of your ideal prospects.

So if you ask me to write a sales letter for you, I will spend the vast majority of my time, like a detective, searching for clues as to **which specific and emotional benefits your product brings to YOUR customer**.

People ALWAYS buy based on emotion. Never logic. My sales-letter research will uncover the "emotional triggers" that motivate people to run to YOUR storefront and bang on YOUR doors at six o'clock in the morning--clamoring for YOUR product lining YOUR shelves (either your figurative or your literal "shelves").

### Long Copy
I go by the classic principle that "the more you write, the more you sell" -- as long as whatever you write grabs ahold of the reader's heart and never lets it go. 

If, right now, you have only a short, feeble, pallid, anemic little sales letter (or none at all yet), get ready see some immensely EXTENDED, ENLIVENED, and **customer-magnetizing sales copy for YOUR product**!

Despite the incessant hype you hear from some online digital marketers, the long-form sales letter is most definitely NOT dead. I just have to laugh whenever I hear people announce its funeral.

Just the other day, I read a sales letter by a lady trying to convince her readers that the long-form sales letter "had died the death!" She wanted to get people to buy into her whiz bang array of "modern digital marketing solutions." And it took a whole lot of verbal 'splaining' to get her point across. By the way, her letter was boring, pallid, and uninspiring. (I guess that's why she doesn't like sales letters.)

### Pulling You In
Here's how gold-standard copywriting really works.

A rip-roaring headline grabs your interest. Your eyes slide down to the first sentence below. This draws you into the second sentence. Your mind flows effortlessly into the third sentence. Before you know it, a wave of fascination carries you along--all the way to the end of the letter. How did this masterpiece of a sales letter draw you in so emotionally? ...so completely? **Because the letter made you want to believe what was promised.**

You traversed through a jungle thicket of bullets, paragraphs, testimonials, features, and benefits until you digested every scrap of the copy because **you yearned for the transformation... the escape... that the letter's promise could bring into your life**.

A stellar sales letter will cause a little fire in your belly, first set alight by the headline, to metamorphosize into a blazing inferno of desire by the end of your read. The letter will convince you to buy... or at least move you to grasp for the free offer.

Why? Because such a letter convinces you that what it sells will bring massively more value into your life than whatever money you'll have to spend.
