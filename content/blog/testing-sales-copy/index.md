Dear Reader,

Most sales copy stinks.

You and I both know that.

Most display ads, brand image builders, video ads, and sales letters bore you to tears with their incalculable blandness. Your subconsciousness screams at them for the umpteenth time, "Why are you doing this to me!"

You and I are forced to endure hundreds of these "odes to artlessness" every single day.

### The long-forgotten past
It wasn't always like this.

Way back in the 1920s, ad copy sang. Ad copy told you stories. Ad copy spoke craftsmanship, finesse, and flair into your life. And do you know what? Ad copy in those days made you wanna buy!

Within the next few months, I will get my "Sales Letter Copywriting testing and writing service" up and running to help businessmen like you transform your "modern lemon" of a Sales Letter into a fine-tuned roadster of classic design **that brings in loads more profits your way**.

### The Best of the New, the Best of the Old
I will apply a unique-in-all-the-world recipe of "new-fangled data science" and "old-timer artistry" to your letter:

### New-fangled Data Science
I will **rapidly test**--with real people similar to your prospects--a whole slew of factors including your teaser copy, your headline, the body of your letter, your bullets (fascinations), your testimonials, your offer, your signature, your P.S.'s, etc.

I will cycle through them all to the n-th degree until **you radically bump up your response and conversion rates**. And I will do this FAST for you. Imagine jumping from a half percent conversion rate to a one percent conversion rate... or more.

And I'm not talking about has-been, water-under-the-bridge, been-there-done-that "A/B Testing" either. (That's so 20-teens.)

Instead, I'm talkin' up-to-the-minute, latest-and-greatest, and yet still mega-battle-tested, SPRINT TESTING. Once I get done running your ad-copy through my sprint testing wringer, you'll have prospects TRANSFIXED to your ad-copy and **aching to buy your product**!

I know what I said might sound like a bunch of snake-oil salesmanship hype, but it's not. I'm telling you the truth. And I've just proven it to you.

**_"How have you proven it to me, Matt?"_** you ask.

I've proven it because I have SPRINT TESTED the daylights out this ad-copy before it ever even got in front of your eyes. Your avid reading of this letter proves to you my sprint testing system worked.

The old ad-man acronym, "A.I.D.A.," from the 1920s stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.

> 1. Attention
> 2. Interest
> 3. Desire
> 4. Action

You can see how my sales letter first attracted your <u>attention</u> in spades. It then attracted your <u>interest</u>. It probably even kindled a "fire in your belly of <u>desire</u>"--**especially when you contemplate how your profits could soon soar**. In fact, it might take only a little nudge to encourage you toward <u>action</u>.

Imagine getting your prospects to this point of "action" a whole lot quicker and a whole lot more frequently than ever before. Orders of magnitude better than before. Imagine what that would mean to you.

Think of how ad-copy like this--**that transfixes the emotions of your hottest prospects**--could TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS AND YOUR LIFE!

### Old-timer Artistry
In tandem with the "New-fangled Data Science," I will also apply the timeless artistry of the "Old School Copywriting Masters" like Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, and the many other great "ad-men of old" to your letter.

Even though I fiddle with new-fangled data science, as a history buff, my heart of hearts pines for the glorious ad-copy style of days gone by.

So when I get ahold of your letter, I will custom tailor it to the "ad-copy golden standards of yonder years" before I hand it back to you.

Think of it this way. Would you rather gaze upon an edifice of late nineteenth century design or some structure slapped together today.

Take a look at a public library built a century ago: a beautiful work of architectural wonder.

Then take a look at one built today: UGLY! BORING! BLAND! SOULLESS!

That's the exact feeling you get when you stare at most ad-copy these days. It reminds me of modern "art." Ugggh!

So what is the benefit of the "old gold" style of ad-copy over the "plastic vanilla" style of today?

And, why did ad-men back then write so much better copy than they do today?

You gotta understand the long odds against a sale the "ad men of old" had to face in those days. Back then, let's say you ran a newspaper ad or mailed out a direct mail piece to thousands of prospects. 

The prospect then would be staring at a piece of physical paper with a cut-out order form next to the ad-copy. The prospective customer would have to...

> 1. Find a scissor.
> 2. Cut out the order form.
> 3. Find a pen.
> 4. Fill out the order form.
> 5. Find an envelop in the house or go out and buy one.
> 6. Write the company address on the envelop.
> 7. Put the order form into the envelop.
> 8. Find a check and write it to the company.
> 9. Put the check in the envelop and seal it.
>10. Find a postage stamp or go out and buy one.
>11. Walk out to the mailbox and plop in the letter.
>12. Flip up the little red flag on the mailbox.
>13. And wait... and wait... and wait.

It's a wonder that salesmen sold ANYTHING via sales letters back in those days! Yet they did. They sold a lot.

But how?

The answer is that they were FORCED by such dire "selling headwinds" to write WORLD-CLASS COPY. This massive inconvenience, this "limitation" from their "selling logistics" forced them to write immensely creative copy that would draw customers in like a high-powered magnet.

The great architect Frank Lloyd Wright once wrote, **_"The human race built most nobly when limitations were greatest, and therefore when most was required of IMAGINATION in order to build at all. Limitations seem to have always been the best friends of architecture."_**

Most copywriting today stinks to the high heavens because modern copywriters don't possess the "**gift of limitations**" that the copywriters of old once made great use of.

Thus modern copywriters tend to pour **_little to no IMAGINATION_** into their ad-copy.

All a modern salesman has to do today is...

> 1. Slap up a website with some half-baked ad-copy on it and an order form.
> 2. Somehow get the prospect to press the "Order" button.
> 3. Get the prospect to fill out the order form and click "SUBMIT". Done.

So "easy"... and so little incentive to produce world-class copywriting.

That's why most ad-copy these days does such a lousy job of bringing in revenue. It is almost universally plain, vanilla, vapid, and BLAND! BLAND! BLAND!

### Online and Offline Copy
In glorious contrast, whether you sell with a website, social media, **direct mail** (my personal favorite), magazine ads, or newspaper ads--or anything else--I will walk alongside you in the crafting of an ad-copy masterpiece.

As you can see right here in this letter, I've set a major LIMITATION on myself. You don't see any fancy graphics. You don't see any fancy images. You don't see any fancy font. All you're looking at is black courier typeface on a white background. Because of this "limitation," I have FORCED myself to "dig deep" to bring forth fast-moving, desire-triggering copywriting. Limitations force my IMAGINATION to work overtime!

### No Sales Letter yet?
If you don't have a sales letter written up yet, no worries. I'll take a turn at it myself -- and inexpensively test the living daylights out of your new letter with real prospects before it goes out into the wild.

When I say, "write a sales letter for you," you need to understand something.

The amount of time I spend with "pen to paper" is only a fraction of the time I will spend on your letter. The vast majority of the time I spend in crafting your copywriting masterpiece will involve RESEARCH.

The copywriting legend Gary Halbert once said, "A great copywriter is not a great writer, but rather, a great LEARNER." Another copywriting legend, Eugene Schwartz, said, "Copywriting is not writing. It is assembling." What he meant was that if copywriting is done extremely well, the copywriter will ASSEMBLE the incredible BENEFITS that your product ALREADY POSSESSES. He will present these benefits in a way that sinks deeply into the hearts of your ideal prospects.

So if you ask me to write or edit a sales letter for you, I will spend the vast majority of my time, like a detective, searching for clues as to **which specific and emotional benefits your product brings to YOUR customer**. I will, as Robert Collier put it, "enter into the conversation your prospects are having now."

People ALWAYS buy based on emotion. Never logic. No matter how "highfalutin and sophisticated" they pretend to be.

My sales-letter research will uncover the "emotional triggers" that motivate certain people to run to YOUR storefront and bang on YOUR doors at six o'clock in the morning--clamoring for YOUR product lining YOUR shelves (either your figurative or your literal "shelves").

### The Long-form Sales Letter
I go by the classic principle that "the more you write, the more you sell" -- as long as what you write grabs ahold of the reader's heart and never lets it go. 

If, right now, you have only a short, feeble, pallid, anemic little sales letter (or none at all yet), get ready see some immensely EXTENDED, ENLIVENED, and **customer-magnetizing sales copy written for YOUR product**!

Despite the incessant hype you hear from some online digital marketers, the long-form sales letter is not dead. I have to laugh whenever I hear people announce its funeral.

Just the other day, I read a sales letter by a lady trying to convince her readers that the long-form sales letter "had died the death." She wanted people to buy into her whiz bang array of "modern digital marketing solutions." And it took a whole lot of verbal 'splaining' to get her point across. And her letter was boring, pallid, and uninspiring. (I guess that's why she doesn't like sales letters.)

### Pulling You In
Here's how gold-standard copywriting really works.

A rip-roaring headline grabs your interest. Your eyes slide down to the first sentence below. This draws you into the second sentence. Your mind flows effortlessly into the third sentence. Before you know it, a wave of fascination carries you along--all the way to the end of the letter. How does a masterpiece sales letter draw you in so emotionally? ...so completely? **Because a letter like this makes you want to believe what it promises.** You will traverse through a jungle thicket of bullets, paragraphs, testimonials, features, and benefits until you digest every scrap of its copy because **you yearn for the transformation... for the escape... that this letter promises to bring into your life**.

A stellar sales letter will first start a little fire in your belly, set alight by the headline. It will then metamorphosize that first flicker into a blazing inferno of desire by the end of your read. The letter will convince you to buy... or at least move you to grasp for the free offer.

Why? Because such a letter convinces you that what it sells will bring massively greater value into your life than whatever money you'll have to spend on it.

That is exactly the state of mind you want to instill into your prospects.

### But There's a Problem
I do want to help lots of small businessmen with their sales letters, but I'm only one person.

Matt Malone.

As a sometimes cantankerous and always picky 57-year-old ;-), I refuse to "outsource" my copywriting to any young whippersnapper copywriter. Dealing with the quality-control hassles of outsourcing just ain't my cup of tea. I custom design all of the copy myself. And I've only got 24 hours in a day.

I've also got seven kids (five still at home) plus my wife, Erin. They don't want me working till ten o'clock every night. I work a 40-hour week so I can enjoy watching my kids grow up. As I'm sure you know, the time you take away from your kids you will never get back.

Therefore, I can only take on so many clients before I have to yell "stop" to any more business flooding my way.

In fact, this ad. This sales letter here. Will very likely have to stop running soon due the influx of small businessmen calling on me for my services. I'll likely have to take this web page down very soon because I don't want to offer a service I can't deliver.

So I might suggest you enter this small window of opportunity now, available to a very limited number of clients, before the door shuts.

By entering this "temporary door of opportunity," you will get the combination of...

> 1. World-class, old-school, classic, long-form copywriting combined with...
> 2. Thoroughly modern and tested data science methodology applied to (a) the determining of your ideal audience/customer-type and (b) the intricate and yet inexpensive testing of every aspect of your sales letter for such people.

After having run your sales letter through such an extensive and rigorous process (which takes about 8-9 weeks with me rather than the year-plus it often takes for many sales letters today--**particularly for my specialty of Direct Mail sales letters**), you will have in your hands a "golden sales letter" that I GUARANTEE will bring you signifantly increased revenue and profits for your business.

And, if it does not bring you these increases within six months of our signing our notarized contract, you will have the option asking for ALL the money back that you paid to me which I will return promptly and courteously to you.

The reason I offer such a ridiculous guarantee is that I believe you will be deliriously happy with the results, revenue-wise & profit-wise, from my work.

Market research is intricate and exacting and can be extremely frustrating for someone in the midst of it. But you have my guarantee that I will not stop until you see major (and measurable) increases in your business's profits.

My success will ride on your success.

### This is Not for Everyone... or is it?
While I've sent this letter out to a significant number of businessmen, and I've precisely targeted its recipients, your responding to this letter will not guarantee that I take you on as my client.

I could possibly take you on as a client if...
> 1. You have been in business for a minimum of two years. I can text with you if you have questions about this criterion.
> 2. You can show me your business is profitable or near-profitable. I can discuss my criteria for "profitabilty" privately with you.
> 3. You are in a field that is conducive to "Direct Response Marketing" (DRM). Some products (like cheap and low-quality commodities) do not sell well with DRM.
> 4. You are very open to a long term business relationship with me. As you may know, the cost of acquiring a first-time client is about eight times the cost of a returning client. I am looking for **long lasting relationships with a small number of clients** rather than a flash-in-the-pan "quick sale" to a whole slew of enquirers.
> 5. You are extremely open to "Matt Malone's style" of hard-hitting, thrill-ride copywriting. I REFUSE to write "corporate stiff" &/or "namby-pamby" copywriting that puts prospects to sleep.
> 6. You believe with every fiber of your being that you sell a top-of-the-line super-high-quality product. These days, we over-use the term "passion," but I do want to see your passion regarding your product. My ad-copy will directly reflect this. Therefore passion must exist.
> 7. You sell a product that does not violate my personal values. I will NOT write copy for controlled substances, gambling, anything even remotely related to sex, or anything that damages the body. You can look at me as kind of an old-fashioned, conservative-values type of fellow who happens to enjoy modern gadgetry. I promote products that help people, not hurt them--be they man, woman, or child.
> 8. You are a "good personality fit" with me. We'll be communicating a lot, so I want BOTH of us to enjoy a stellar business relationship.

{I will write more in the coming days. This letter is currently under construction. I'm not ready at this point to start any business relationships yet. **But that day will soon arrive!** So stay in touch via Facebook. You know the drill. Like my page, send me a Facebook Message to which I'll respond, etc, etc.}
