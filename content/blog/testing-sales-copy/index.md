Dear Reader,

Most sales copy stinks.

You and I both know that.

Most display ads, "brand image builders," and video sales letters annoy and offend you to no end with their incalculable blandness. "Why are you BORING me with this!" your subconsciousness screams for the umpteenth time today. You're forced to endure hundreds of these "odes to artlessness" every day, by the way.

### The long-forgotten past
It didn't used to be like this.  Way back in the 1920s, ad copy sang. Ad copy told you stories. Ad copy spoke beauty to your heart. And do you know what? Ad copy made you wanna buy!

Within the next couple of months, I will get my "Sales Letter Copywriting testing service" up and running to help businessmen like you transform your "modern" lemon of a Sales Letter into a fine-tuned roadster of classic design.

### The Best of the New, the Best of the Old
I will apply a unique mixture of "new-fangled data science" and "old-timer artistry" to your letter:

### New-fangled Data Science
I will test--with real prospects similar to your own--a whole slew of factors including your teaser copy, your headline, the body of your letter, your bullets (fascinations), your testimonials, your offer, your P.S.'s, your signature, etc. So much to test! I'll cycle through them all to the n-th degree until you radically bump up your response and conversion rates.

### Old-timer Artistry
I will also apply the timeless principles of the "Old School Copywriting Masters" like Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, and the many other greats to your letter.

Even though I fiddle with digital marketing data, as a history buff, my heart of hearts pines for the glorious ad-copy of days gone by. When I get ahold of your letter, I will custom tailor it to "golden ad-copy standards of yonder years" before I hand it back to you.

Think of it this way. Would you rather gaze upon a building of late nineteenth century design or a building slapped together today. Take a look at a public library built a century ago... beautiful!

Then take a look at one built today: UGLY! BORING! BLAND! SOULLESS!

It's the exact same feeling you get when you stare at most ads these days. They remind me of modern "art." Groan!

### Online and Offline
Whether you sell with a website, social media, direct mail, magazine ads, or newspaper ads--or anything else--I will walk alongside you in the crafting of an ad-copy masterpiece.

### No Sales Letter yet?
By the way, if you don't have a sales letter written up yet, no worries. I'll take a turn at it myself -- and test the living daylights out of your new letter before it goes out into the wild.

### Long Copy
One note before I go, I am very partial to LONG COPY. I go by the classic principle that "the more you write, the more you sell" -- as long as what you write grabs ahold of the reader's heart and never lets it go! 

If you send me a short, piddly little sales letter, get ready see it EXTENDED -- in some cases, immensely.

Despite the incessant hype you hear from some online digital marketers, the long form sales letter is most definitely NOT dead! I just have to laugh whenever I hear people announce its funeral.

Just the other day, I read a long form sales letter by a lady trying to convince her readers that the long form sales letter has died! She wanted to get people to buy into her whiz bang array of "modern" selling solutions! And it took a whole lot of verbal 'splaining' to get her point across! ...and her letter was boring and uninspiring, by the way. (I guess that's why she doesn't like sales letters.)

If some rip-roaring headline has piqued your interest, and then you dip your toe into the first sentence, which pulls you into the second sentence and so on, you will quickly find yourself carried along to the very end. You will take the time to read your whole way through! You will traverse through a jungle thicket of bullets, paragraphs, testimonials and benefits until you've digested every scrap of the copy. A stellar sales letter will cause the little fire in your belly, first set alight by the headline, to metamorphosize into a blazing inferno of desire by the very end of your read! The letter will convince you to buy... or at least grasp for the free offer!

{I have a whole lot more to write, by the way. This letter is currently under construction! ;-) So stay in touch on Facebook! You know the routine. Like my page, yadda, yadda, yadda....}
