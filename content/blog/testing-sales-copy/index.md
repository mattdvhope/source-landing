Dear Reader,

Most sales copy stinks.

You and I both know that.

Most display ads, brand image builders, and video sales letters annoy and offend you to no end with their incalculable blandness. "Why are you BORING me with this!" your subconsciousness screams for the umpteenth time.

We're forced to endure hundreds of these "odes to artlessness" every day.

### The long-forgotten past
It didn't used to be like this.  Way back in the 1920s, ad copy sang. Ad copy told you stories. Ad copy spoke beauty to your heart. And do you know what? Ad copy made you wanna buy!

Within the next couple of months, I will get my "Sales Letter Copywriting testing service" up and running to help businessmen like you transform your "modern" lemon of a Sales Letter into a fine-tuned roadster of classic design.

### The Best of the New, the Best of the Old
I will apply a unique mixture of "new-fangled data science" and "old-timer artistry" to your letter:

### New-fangled Data Science
I will rapidly test--with real prospects similar to your own--a whole slew of factors including your teaser copy, your headline, the body of your letter, your bullets (fascinations), your testimonials, your offer, your signature, your P.S.'s, etc.

I will cycle through them all to the n-th degree until **you radically bump up your response and conversion rates**. Imagine jumping from a half percent conversion rate to a one percent conversion rate... or more.

And I'm not talking about old-fashioned, water-under-the-bridge, been-there-done-that "A/B Testing." (That's so 20-teens!) I'm talkin' up-to-the-minute, latest-and-greatest (and yet still mega-battle-tested) SPRINT TESTING! Once I get through running your ad-copy through the sprint testing wringer, you'll have your prospects TRANSFIXED to your ad-copy!

I know what I just said might sound like a bunch of snake-oil salesmanship hype, but it's true. And I've just proven it to you.

"How have you proven it to me, Matt?" you ask me, now. Here's how: YOU'RE TRANSFIXED TO THIS SALES LETTER, AREN'T YOU! At this very moment, you're engaged and entraptured by the words flying in front of your eyeballs. And do you know why? Because I'd spent the last eight-plus weeks SPRINT TESTING the daylights out this ad-copy! And it got your attention, didn't it! ;-)

The old ad-man acronym, "A.I.D.A.(S.)," from the 1920s stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action (& "Satisfaction," if you want to add that). You can see that my sales letter you're reading now has gotten your "attention" in spades. And I'd be willing to bet that it's also gotten your "interest." I might even guess that it's kindled a fair desire of "desire" in your belly. In fact, it might only take just a little more pushing over the edge for you to take "action." Imagine you getting your prospects to this point of "action" a whole lot quicker and a whole lot more frequently than ever before--orders of magnitude better than before. Imagine it.

Think about how YOU (with me by your side) belting out ad-copy like this--that transfixes the eyeballs & emotions of your hottest prospects--would TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS AND YOUR LIFE, money-wise! Think about it.

### Old-timer Artistry
I will also apply the timeless principles of the "Old School Copywriting Masters" like Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, and the many other great "ad-men of old" to your letter.

Even though I fiddle with digital marketing data, as a history buff, my heart of hearts pines for the glorious ad-copy of days gone by. When I get ahold of your letter, I will custom tailor it to "golden ad-copy standards of yonder years" before I hand it back to you.

Think of it this way. Would you rather gaze upon a building of late nineteenth century design or a building slapped together today.

Take a look at a public library built a century ago... a beautiful work of architectural wonder.

Then take a look at one built today: UGLY! BORING! BLAND! SOULLESS!

It's the exact same feeling you get when you stare at most ads these days. They remind me of modern "art." Groan!

### Online and Offline
Whether you sell with a website, social media, direct mail, magazine ads, or newspaper ads--or anything else--I will walk alongside you in the crafting of an ad-copy masterpiece.

### No Sales Letter yet?
If you don't have a sales letter written up yet, no worries. I'll take a turn at it myself -- and test the living daylights out of your new letter before it goes out into the wild.

### Long Copy
One note before I go, I am very partial to LONG COPY. I go by the classic principle that "the more you write, the more you sell" -- as long as what you write grabs ahold of the reader's heart and never lets it go! 

If you send me a short, piddly little sales letter, get ready see it EXTENDED -- in some cases, immensely.

Despite the incessant hype you hear from some online digital marketers, the long form sales letter is most definitely NOT dead! I just have to laugh whenever I hear people announce its funeral.

Just the other day, I read a long form sales letter by a lady trying to convince her readers that the long-form sales letter is dead! She wanted to get people to buy into her whiz bang array of "modern digital marketing solutions." And it took a whole lot of verbal 'splaining' to get her point across! Her letter was boring and uninspiring, by the way. (I guess that's why she doesn't like sales letters.)

### Pulling You In
Here's how gold-standard copywriting works: A rip-roaring headline piques your interest. Then you dip your toe into the first sentence below. This draws you into the second sentence. You find your mind effortlessly flowing into the third sentence. Before you know it, a wave of fascination carries you along to the very end of the letter. You took the time to read your whole way through. Why? **Because you want to believe what the letter promises.**

You will traverse through a jungle thicket of bullets, paragraphs, testimonials, features, and benefits until you've digested every scrap of the copy.

A stellar sales letter will cause the little fire in your belly, first set alight by the headline, to metamorphosize into a blazing inferno of desire by the end of your read. The letter will convince you to buy... or at least move you to grasp for the free offer.

{I have a whole lot more to write, by the way. This letter is currently under construction! ;-) So stay in touch on Facebook! You know the routine. Like my page, send me a Facebook Message, yadda, yadda, yadda....}
