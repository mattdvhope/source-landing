Dear Reader,

Most sales copy stinks.

You and I both know that.

Most display ads, brand image builders, video sales letters, and written sales letters annoy and offend you to no end with their incalculable blandness. "Why are you BORING me with this!" your subconsciousness screams for the umpteenth time.

We are forced to endure hundreds of these "odes to artlessness" every single day.

### The long-forgotten past
It wasn't always like this.  Way back in the 1920s, ad copy sang. Ad copy told you stories. Ad copy spoke craftsmanship, finesse, and flair into your heart. And do you know what? Ad copy back then made you wanna buy!

Within the next couple of months, I will get my "Sales Letter Copywriting testing service" up and running to help businessmen like you transform your "modern lemon" of a Sales Letter into a fine-tuned roadster of classic design that brings in loads more profits for you.

### The Best of the New, the Best of the Old
I will apply a unique mixture of "new-fangled data science" and "old-timer artistry" to your letter:

### New-fangled Data Science
I will **rapidly test**--with real prospects similar to your own--a whole slew of factors including your teaser copy, your headline, the body of your letter, your bullets (fascinations), your testimonials, your offer, your signature, your P.S.'s, etc.

I will cycle through them all to the n-th degree until **you radically bump up your response and conversion rates**. Imagine jumping from a half percent conversion rate to a one percent conversion rate... to more.

And I'm not talking about old-fashioned, water-under-the-bridge, been-there-done-that "A/B Testing" either. (That's so 20-teens.) I'm talkin' up-to-the-minute, latest-and-greatest, and yet still mega-battle-tested, SPRINT TESTING. Once I get done running your ad-copy through the sprint testing wringer, you'll have your prospects TRANSFIXED to your ad-copy.

I know what I said might sound like a bunch of snake-oil salesmanship hype, but it's true. And I've just proven it to you.

"How have you proven it to me, Matt?" you ask me.

Here's how: YOU'RE TRANSFIXED TO THIS SALES LETTER, AREN'T YOU? At this very moment, you're engaged and enraptured by the words flying in front of your eyeballs. And do you know why? Because I had SPRINT TESTED the daylights out this ad-copy. And it got your attention, didn't it!

The old ad-man acronym, "A.I.D.A.," from the 1920s stands for Attention, Interest, Desire, Action.

You can see that my sales letter got your "attention" in spades. And I'll bet it also attracted your "interest." It's probably even kindled a fair amount of "desire" in your belly when you imagine how your profits could soon soar. In fact, it might only take a little nudge over the edge for you to take "action."

Imagine you getting your prospects to this point of "action" a whole lot quicker and a whole lot more frequently than ever before--orders of magnitude better than before. Imagine what it would mean to you.

Think about how ad-copy like this--**that transfixes the eyeballs & emotions of your hottest prospects**--will TRANSFORM YOUR BUSINESS AND YOUR LIFE!

### Old-timer Artistry
I will also apply the timeless principles of the "Old School Copywriting Masters" like Robert Collier, Claude Hopkins, and the many other great "ad-men of old" to your letter.

Even though I fiddle with new-fangled data science, as a history buff, my heart of hearts pines for the glorious ad-copy style of days gone by.

So when I get ahold of your letter, I will custom tailor it to "ad-copy golden standards of yonder years" before I hand it back to you.

Think of it this way. Would you rather gaze upon an edifice of late nineteenth century design or some structure slapped together today.

Take a look at a public library built a century ago: a beautiful work of architectural wonder.

Then take a look at one built today: UGLY! BORING! BLAND! SOULLESS!

That's the exact same feeling you get when you stare at most ad-copy these days. It reminds me of modern "art." Ugggh!

And, by the way, most modern ad-copy does a lousy job of bringing in revenue for your business.

### Online and Offline
Whether you sell with a website, social media, direct mail, magazine ads, or newspaper ads--or anything else--I will walk alongside you in the crafting of an ad-copy masterpiece.

### No Sales Letter yet?
If you don't have a sales letter written up yet, no worries. I'll take a turn at it myself -- and test the living daylights out of your new letter with real prospects before it goes out into the wild.

And when I say, "write a sales letter for you," you need to understand something.

The amount of time I spend with "pen to paper" is only a fraction of the time I'll spend on your letter. The vast majority of the time I spend in crafting this copywriting masterpiece for you will be in RESEARCH.

The great copywriting legend Gary Halbert once said, "A great copywriter is not a great writer, but rather, a great LEARNER." Another copywriting legend, Eugene Schwartz, said, "Copywriting is not writing. It is assembling." What he meant was that if copywriting is done extremely well, the copywriter will ASSEMBLE the incredible BENEFITS that your product brings to a customer. And he will present these benefits in a way that sinks deep into the hearts of your ideal prospects.

So if you ask me to write a sales letter for you, I will spend the vast majority of my time, like a detective, searching for clues as to which specific and emotional benefits your product brings to the customer.

People ALWAYS buy based on emotion--never based on logic. My sales-letter research will uncover the "emotional triggers" that motivate people to run to YOUR storefront and bang on its doors at six o'clock in the morning--clamoring for that product lining your shelves.

### Long Copy
I go by the classic principle that "the more you write, the more you sell" -- as long as whatever you write grabs ahold of the reader's heart and never lets it go. 

If you show me a short, piddly, feeble, pallid, anemic little sales letter, get ready see it EXTENDED -- in some cases, immensely.

Despite the incessant hype you hear from some online digital marketers, the long-form sales letter is most definitely NOT dead. I just have to laugh whenever I hear people announce its funeral.

Just the other day, I read a sales letter by a lady trying to convince her readers that the long-form sales letter "had died the death!" She wanted to get people to buy into her whiz bang array of "modern digital marketing solutions." And it took a whole lot of verbal 'splaining' to get her point across. By the way, her letter was boring, pallid, and uninspiring. (I guess that's why she doesn't like sales letters.)

### Pulling You In
Here's how gold-standard copywriting really works: A rip-roaring headline piques your interest. Then you dip your toe into the first sentence below. This draws you into the second sentence. Your mind then effortlessly flows into the third sentence. Before you know it, a wave of fascination carries you along to the very end of the letter. You take the time to read the whole way through. Why? **Because you want to believe what the letter promises.**

You will traverse through a jungle thicket of bullets, paragraphs, testimonials, features, and benefits until you've digested every scrap of the copy because **you yearn for what it promises**.

A stellar sales letter will cause the little fire in your belly, first set alight by the headline, to metamorphosize into a blazing inferno of desire by the end of your read. The letter will convince you to buy... or at least move you to grasp for the free offer.

Why? Because such a letter convinces you that what it sells will bring massively more value into your life than whatever money you'll spend.
